# Open Source Mobile Offline First Life Tracking App

For the unintiated life tracking is the process of monitoring and cataloguing all diffferent aspects of your life. Everything from the usual exercise related metrics most people tend to track (steps, calories etc) to the more mundane tasks such as number of pages read, and hours spent coding.

# What's the point?

The goal of all this data is to track user's mood/happiness index in tandem as well. This data will allow the app to use machine learning and data science to find and highlight trends in one's habits and their percieved habits/activities. Maybe you'll learn that on days that you read more you inexplicable feel much happier than when you don't. This might feel like an obvious enough takeaway but with enough data this app will show you trends that you might not have ever paid attention to or would have thought were apparent. For example you might find that when you spend time coding hobby projects you feel better but you feel even better when you code, avoid sugary drinks and exercise all together!

# What's Special With This Implementation?

PRIVACY! I've found a lack of any such apps (atleast on android) and for the select few that do exist always have some online based features. That luxury comes with the understandable fear of privacy. You can never be sure whether the developer is harvesiting sensitive personal data such as health data.

That's why LiTa is an offline-first open source application. If you ever feel that the proposition of being completly offline isn't really true you're more than welcome to come take a look at the application code directly.
